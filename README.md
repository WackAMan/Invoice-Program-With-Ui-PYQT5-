# Invoice-Program-With-Ui-PYQT5-
A simple program i made for my mum to send invoices to her own clients, with built in email sending, stores client data, pdf invoice creation, validation for inputted data, edit personal/client data and deleting/restoring client files

this is also my first ever time using github so im not sure how it works therefore i disabled the actual emailing to prevent people randomly emailing people just incase

you will need to run installation.py before running the main program
run main.py to start it
