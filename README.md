# Invoice-Program-With-Ui-PYQT5-
A simple program i made for my mum to send invoices to her own clients, with built in email sending, stores client data, pdf invoice creation, validation for inputted data, edit personal/client data and deleting/restoring client files

if you wish to use this for your own clients please feel free to do so, all data is stored within text files internally on the computer as i have no idea how to store data safely so use at your own risk
if using it on your own you will need to go into the files and change line 128 and 131 to your personal email.
line  128 will be specific to your email provider;
outlook: smtp-mail.outlook.com
yahoo: smtp.mail.yahoo.com
gmail: smtp.gmail.com
for line 131 you will need to create an app password within your browser for your email and simply put it within the quotation marks
you will also need to re-enable the emailing subroutine (turned it off so people dont use it within the github preview)
